A,Hajj is not wajib on you.
M,"If all other tests pass, your duty is to send a nayeb for Hajj."
N,"If all other tests pass, you have a choice between sending a nayeb or waiting for your recovery and performing it yourself. Performing it yourself is Afzal (preferred). However, if you send a nayeb and later recover, you might have to redo it. Taking a nayeb is not wajib, and if you die before recovery while anticipating recovery, Hajj will not become mustaqarr on you."
Z,"Hajj is wajib on you. However, since your health does not allow you to perform Hajj yourself, it is wajib on you to send a nayeb."

K,Test passed successfully.
X,"Since you cannot go to Hajj yourself and need to take a nayeb, it is not wajib on you to accept the Bazl, and even if you do so, you will not be considered mustatee."
V,"Full Hajj package means that the package covers all the costs of: 1) Provisions for Hajj 2) Travel expenses for Hajj 3) Living expenses of dependents (and others) while you are away for Hajj. If such a package is offered to someone, it becomes wajib on him to accept it. (Help text: This wujub applies to those for whom Hajj has not become mustaqarr. For those on whom Hajj has become mustaqarr but who currently lack resources, accepting Bazl is wajib only if that is the only way to perform Hajj.)"
L,Test failed.
Y,"Partial Hajj package gift applies when you have funds of your own, but they are not sufficient to cover all Hajj costs. However, if they are supplemented by a gift that covers: 1) Provisions for Hajj 2) Travel expenses for Hajj 3) Living expenses of dependents (and others) while you are away, it becomes wajib on you to accept it. (Help text: This wujub applies to those for whom Hajj has not become mustaqarr. For those on whom Hajj has become mustaqarr but who lack resources, accepting Bazl is wajib only if that is the only way to perform Hajj.)"
T,"Please answer the following questions to determine your financial ability for Hajj. Keep in mind: 1) If you have possessions you don’t need and selling them can cover Hajj expenses, you should select Yes. For example, jewellery that was once necessary but no longer is due to old age can count toward Hajj funds. 2) If you own a house that can be sold and replaced with a cheaper one (still suitable for your status) without hardship, you should select Yes."
ZC,It is wajib on you to pay Khums and/or Zakat.
ZD,"Hajj is not obligatory on you this year. However, if you have itminaan (certainty) that in the coming year or years all the other conditions for Hajj will be fulfilled and you will be able to perform it, then it becomes wajib on you to preserve the financial means for Hajj. If you do not have such certainty, then it is not wajib to protect or preserve those funds."
ZE,"Your duty is to refrain from performing Hajj and instead fulfill the more important wajib. However, if you still proceed with Hajj, it will be valid and counted as Hajjatul Islam."
